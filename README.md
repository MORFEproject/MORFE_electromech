# MORFE_Electromech

This repo implements the method and a couple of examples from:
* A. Frangi, A. Colombo, A. Vizzaccaro, C. Touze'. Reduced order modelling of fully coupled electro-mechanical systems through invariant manifolds with applications to microstructures (2024) 


The code uses [MATLAB.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MATLAB.jl) to compute the generalised eigenvalue problem: please make sure to double check if your specifications match those required by the package (in particular, versions R2022 and R2023 do not work!).
